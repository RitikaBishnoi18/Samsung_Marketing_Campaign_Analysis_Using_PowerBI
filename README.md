# Samsung_Marketing_Campaign_Analysis_Using_PowerBI
Project where I delved into the world of marketing campaigns, focusing on optimizing sales and customer satisfaction for Samsung's newly launched products. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the journey:

# Understanding Marketing Concepts & KPIs:
Started by diving deep into the key concepts of marketing and campaign management to understand the critical KPIs that drive success.

# Data Modeling:
Designed a robust data model using the Snowflake schema to identify the necessary data for our analysis.

# Data Creation:
Generated the required data from scratch, ensuring accuracy and relevance for our analysis.

# Data Integration with Power BI:
Integrated the created data seamlessly into Power BI for further analysis.

# Data Transformation:
Transformed the data to make KPI depiction intuitive and straightforward.

# Visual Creation:
Developed compelling visuals to represent the sales and revenue performance of Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 across different campaigns.

# Insight Generation & Future Considerations:
Analyzed the report to extract valuable insights and identified future considerations for campaign strategies, such as:

# Maximizing Campaign Effectiveness: 
Video ads showed the highest success, followed by Shopping ads, with Local Search ads needing improvement.
# Revenue Insights: 
Equal units of both products were sold, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 generated more revenue due to its higher price.
# Demographic Trends: 
Middle-aged female consumers in the USA, particularly single individuals, were the largest contributors to sales.
